# History of Rollup
Rollup is a good Hook based Framework to describe build processes via plugins to improve performance they did take the wrong way
with version 4 they introduce a swc wasm build that is not needed and destroys the project at a whole version 3 uses estree 
acorn which is the right thing to do. To Imrpove performance you need to use rollup cache and split your project into indipendent
builds. 

also the node watch feature is usefull and can be replace by custom hooks in the browser for the opfs

the types also need correction favor types over interfaces

replace all interfaces with types and inline as much types as possible also define objects as const and with default values to fix the type issues.
