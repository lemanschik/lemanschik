# Chromium
The chromium platform at present is based on a module / compoent layer with legacy bloat
while both are not optimal the real solution is to let v8 build it self and other v8 components.

so the component module tree needs a complet shift the shell should be a result of the v8 context
and the shell should not embedded the v8 context v8 should embedded the shell.

together with arrayBuffer transfer we can archive the best component system in the world that is able to 
operate on dynamicaly programm able memory. Which leads to AwesomeOS's final goal of a World Wide Distributed Memory Grid
based on world wide scedulted distributed locking and cycling.

## A JS or maybe WASM version of the repotools

## Running Chromium Builds fully distributed in Chromium Browsers.
