        Module resolution can be very difficult to configure correctly!

        Be sure you've read the docs and asked for help in other places before filling out this form.

        Most module resolution bug reports are actually misconfigurations, so we require a thorough pre-investigation before we can look into any potential issues.

        Let's make sure you're ready to file a module resolution bug.

        A module resolution bug requires five things:

        1. A module that's trying to import some target module
        2. That target module
        3. The configuration of the importing module
        4. The configuration of the target module
        5. A difference in runtime behavior

        You will also be required to post a cloneable repository.
        This repo must involve running `tsc`, not a third-party tool (e.g. vue-tsc, ngc, expo, ...)

  - type: input
    id: repo-url
    attributes:
      label: Demo Repo
      description: Post a cloneable repo that reproduces the issue. We will run `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm` here, but will not invoke more complex build scripts or other build tools.

      label: Which of the following problems are you reporting?
      options:
        - The module specifier resolves at runtime, but not at build time
        - The module specifier resolves at build time, but shouldn't because it doesn't at runtime
        - The module specifier resolves, but to the wrong file
        - The module specifier resolves to the right file, but something about the types are wrong
        - Something else more complicated which I'll explain in more detail
