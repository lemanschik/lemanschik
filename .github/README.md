Using Stealify Lang to deliver code bespratices and security out of the box no matter which Languages your using to compose your Applications.
Allows you to reuse Polyglot Code as Modules that Run in any browser Compatible Environment...... 

Architectural Efforts, Standards, Language Interop, Generic Environment Agnostic Platform to create Cross Platform Applications, Compiler Optimization, 

Main Focus: 
ESHost based Lanaguage Implementation Framework and Compiler Feedback Interfaces. To Easy Integrate and Launch Watch Polyglot Code on the Stack that Composes Chromium Platforms. As Also Capability and Isolation Security Concepts. Optimizing API's for Shared Memory and File Interop via Handel based Protocols also making Fundamentals to make a more Development Frindly MOJO Replacement based on V8 it self and the justjs runtime example demo showing the cpp function template call pattern to generate a generic v8/eshost based Module System for the Platform.

Leading the effort to Implement all Chromium Platform Components and Modules via a Stealify IDL written for the chromium Platform Build that supports the current used build tools eg: GN+NINJA+MESON+CMAKE+PYTHON ..... And turn them all into a Declarativ Uinified Language and later replace them with our own
Stack Complete.

## Main Missinterpretation of information that is written here
Stealify Lang Modules to not expose something that gets loaded they expose something that is already loaded!
That makes them also Diffrent fundamental from ECMAScript Modules which assume the fetch load instantion flow. 
While Stealify Language Modules can get handled in a fetch load instantion flow the flow it self is not a core concept
of stealify as stealify represents static compiled resources. Thats also why they got a own extension while the syntax in general is
ECMAScript Compatible und the Assumption that the Runtime Offers all needed Interfaces. Stealify modules can be more seen as ECMAScript Runtime BuildIn Modules that get imported via a chose able reference that allows you to rename and map symbols to better express your Application that you compose... 

## Goals Archived by the effort
- Implements Linux VFS Interface as ESModule designed to work with opfs as interop layer.
- Can Build Linux & Chromium Multi Arch in Any Browser via virtual cpu instructions and wasm. 
- Language Implementation framework support eg: Stealify Lang 
  - Faster Experiments Easyer transformation into components composed out of modules that get called via cpp function template that throws a isolate into them. see: just-js 
  - Polyglot Language => Nativ BuiltIn module JIT. 
  - even more frindly then Torque Lang and can create Domain Related Lang => Torque
- WebRTC Shared Build Network drop in replacement for goma and gerrit
  - Can cache net wide build results for faster loading and distribution no additional storage needed.
  - Advanced partial checkout support via git worktrees combined out of directory based branches. 
  - Faster Incremental Rolling Builds less tooling overhead


## Tutorial 
- Test Docker Wasm https://docs.docker.com/desktop/wasm/
- how to use DIREKTSPEED Cloud with your Existing Google collab Notebooks via 
  - The DIREKTSPEED Cloud Chrome Extension needs Chromium Extension Manifest Compatible Browser.
  - NodeJS vis the @direktspeed/cloud cli and module needs current chromium installed
  - Vert.x / ES4X In your Java / NODEJS GraalVM Quarkus Applications 
  - The B8G Runtime includes B8G Cloud Runtime and is a Internal Only Tech only offerd as SaaS. 

### Working on
- Cloud First Component Manager and System for Desktop and Headless Instances of DIREKTSPEED Cloud a Chromium driven Cloud Stack.
  - @component-manager/cloud
- Cloud Build tools and ide's
  - @unlicense-code/editor
- AI Models for Advanced Code Compilation
  - Not Open Source but see notes in Stealify DIREKTSPEED internal uses the Stealify Lang Compiler and a variaty of AI Models to optimize builds and software analyzes running on DIREKTSPEED Cloud. 


DIREKTSPEED Cloud is an advanced, modern operating system designed to make cloud and desktop computing faster, safer, and more reliable than ever before. It offers a wide range of features, such as a modern user interface, high performance, advanced security, and a robust set of applications. DIREKTSPEED Cloud also provides an easy-to-use platform for developing and running applications, both on desktops and mobile devices. With its advanced capabilities, V8 is an ideal choice for anyone looking to get the most out of their computer. We turned V8 with some additions into B8G Big Engine the most advanced Net Wide Cloud Operating system the first of its kind. Forget about anything that you know about Creating Cross Platform Software and run it at Scale even on day 3 cost is reduced to a never seen rational compared to other Solutions. Run your twitch, Twitter, amazon compatible cloud directly from your laptop and cache it for free on a user-based CDN it automatically scales and syncs with your user base.

Customer Support:
I earn my money as private consulatant for software creating depending companys that want to improve build, development, security audit and deployment as also operational processes to be able to faster iterate over the software that they create as also help them to obtain data needed to imrpove the software. In general i Help them to reduce the overall Software needed to archive the same goals and reduce overall Development and Projects cost by minimum of 10x. I can make such claims even for the most modern Projects on earth. From cloudflare till microsoft cloud challange me if i can not deliver you get all for free but should i deliver i get 1 year 80% of your calculated savings as i take all the risks.

- I mainly like efficent simple reuseable code patterns the real efficent once.
- I hate State creating state without a need is like obfusication of code. 
- I design Api's that let you create more simple code for your Browser. 
- I design deployment and build processes for next gen builds that run anywhere. 
- I learned to hate tools i see most of the easy to use tools as sympthom of the bad code we created in the past.
- I try to identifie antipatterns that other call best practices as this practices lead us to the problems that we already got they are fundamental wrong.
- I Try to spread the word that Databases are hurting us and that they where invented only to solve cache issues on slow spinning disks 
- I understand git more well then most of the tools combined and i would have understood it even more fast if there where no tools and it would get shared as packaging design fundamentals for projects. 

Founder and Next Thinker of Projects like: Web 4.0, components-manager (a universal component manager that even works online in a browser), next gen chromium / nodejs / electron / graalvm builds and the platforms, Setter of standards for the Web 4.0 like the web-modules standard that shows your how to use your web browser and all connected peers like a world wide distributed build grid with Persistent RAM. Makes you cloud indipendent in fact every PC that you use is a own cloud/domain/server/identity Provider.

The most big issues with npm can be seen in my book why you should switch away from nodejs and npm

## Current Projects needs cleanup after rolling out notebooks
- mainly working on git for the web at present as there exist no real git implementation with web concepts.
- Alignments
  - Fuchsia OS, Android OS, LaCrOS, Chromium OS, Linux, WSL3.0, BSD, Mach Kernel (MacOS).
  - NPM, PNP, ECMAScriptModules, 
  - Chromium, WPE, WInterOP
  - Online Editors and DevTools as also Operator Tools. Automation Instrumentation Debugging.
  - Compiler tooling and build tooling
    - Low Level Optimizations to take the best out of:
      - The NasaASM Stack partial rewritten where it is usefull to ECMAScript.
      - The GNU Stack partial rewritten where it is usefull to ECMAScript.
      - The LLVM Stack partial rewritten where it is usefull to ECMAScript.
    - MSON written in ECMAScript
    - GN & Ninja written in ECMAScript
    - Python => ECMAScript Converter. for Python deprecation net wide. 
    - Adapter tool chains for all kinds of languages and package management systems. 
 - Performance and optimization of internals

## writer of the stuff after 0xAA55 ....

ECMAScript is a wrong understood as a language when applyed to glue code in a expressiv way without abusiv use it is a Highly Expressiv Incremental
Typesafe Lang that has a Module System and can be used to define IDL's Interface definition languages like the Lisp macros from rust but we have a builtIn Rust in fact we can generate directly ASM in a much more compose able way then the rust compiler can do that. We can use tagged template literals to express code in any source form and transform it elegant expressiv. In Fact the DOM API shows exactly how well we can define a IDL in ECMAScript it self.
So this replaces the LUA Concept with a High Performant ECMAScript Host that has builtIn Compiler abilitys to compile it self!
