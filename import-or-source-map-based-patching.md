# Source Map Based Patching 
A pattern to develop software without changing the source and even extend it at runtime to be able to faster create custom software with more code reuse and less energy consumption.

## Observation
Many Software gets PreBuild often intermediate Source formats get used aka Frameworks and Templating. Live Patching via ESM Source Import maps can extend modify and even create new software without touching the original source.

## Why is it better then Patching existing source
- No Additional Copys of the existing codes are needed. Much Higher code reuse.
- Code Can be used without reCompilation / Build.
- Speeds up development process on any scale.
- Allows Customer Adjusted behavior.
- ...... Many more need more time to find the correct description as it is a Fundamental change to use existing Software as Is and Modify it even multiple times diffrerently.


## HistoryIn 2014, when the ECMAScript Modules (ESM) standard emerged, I knew instantly that this was a game-changer for the world of software development. Having been deeply entrenched in development pipelines and build support utilities for years, I saw the evidence that this new standard could streamline the often chaotic landscape of JavaScript development. But my journey into the world of open-source software had started much earlier.

Since the early 2000s, I’ve been immersed in the open-source community. My first encounter was with PHP and Apache, where I quickly transitioned from learning to contributing, focusing on developing Content Management Systems (CMS) and Database Management solutions. These early experiences revealed a fundamental truth to me: software development, even at its simplest, is fraught with challenges. Version incompatibility was rampant, and what seemed like small details could become monumental obstacles. The lack of standardization and the fractured ecosystem meant that even straightforward projects could spiral into complexity.

As I became more involved in large-scale software development, I dedicated myself to understanding why these problems existed. Why were teams constantly facing integration issues? Why did maintenance take up so much time, and why was software so prone to breaking in production environments? I began to systematically research every facet of software creation, maintenance, and operation, driven by a need to solve these persistent issues.

This research led me down a path of exploring the bleeding edge of software infrastructure and orchestration technologies. I immersed myself in studying technologies like Google Borg and Kubernetes, which have since become the backbone of modern cloud-native applications. These technologies addressed many of the scalability and resilience problems that plagued traditional infrastructures, but they introduced their own complexities. My studies didn’t stop there. I delved deep into containerization with Docker and experimented with Linux jails, understanding the nuanced differences in how systems could be isolated and managed. Systemd, with its role in system and service management, also became an area of focus as I sought to better understand how operating systems handle processes in modern distributed environments.

During this time, I also explored the less glamorous but equally crucial elements of software architecture—compression algorithms, database design, virtual machines, and media formats. Each of these areas brought its own unique set of challenges, and by studying them in detail, I was able to connect the dots between the layers of abstraction that make modern software work. Understanding how these layers interact was critical to my growth as a developer and researcher, as it equipped me to tackle problems that many saw as inevitable in software production.

My current research focuses on distributed communication and task processing, one of the most experimental and complex areas of software development. This field, despite its incredible potential, remains difficult to solve at scale. Existing solutions often fall short, either because they don’t scale well or because they aren’t flexible enough to handle real-world variability. I’ve spent countless hours studying and experimenting with distributed systems, always pushing to find more efficient ways to enable reliable communication between services and better manage task execution across vast, decentralized networks.

But I believe the future of software lies in combining this deep infrastructure knowledge with the power of artificial intelligence. As developers, we spend a significant amount of time configuring, tuning, and adjusting our systems to meet ever-changing requirements. I envision a world where AI is woven into the software stack, enabling systems to "automagically" adjust and optimize themselves based on real-time conditions. By embedding intelligence into the infrastructure, we can create smaller, leaner, and more adaptable software that meets users' needs without manual intervention. This approach would not only simplify development but also unlock new possibilities for innovation and creativity.

Looking ahead, I am excited about the potential of AI-driven software architectures to reduce the complexity of modern systems and allow developers to focus on building impactful solutions. The future of software is one where technology works for us—not the other way around—and I am committed to being part of this evolution.
